# AlwaysBeCoding
A repository to hold my practice code for interviews

I plan to eventually, program each algorithm and data structure in the following languages:

- C++
- C#
- Scala
- Python

I am primarily following the [coding interview university][1] github page

Books I should go through:

1. [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844)
1. [Programming Pearls](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Pearls-2nd-Jon-Bentley/dp/0201657880)
1. [C Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628)
